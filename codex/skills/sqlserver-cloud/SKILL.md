## Codex adaptation

This local adaptation uses Codex tools and follows the user's request and active AGENTS.md instructions. These platform notes take precedence over conflicting upstream tool examples below.

- Load skills by reading their SKILL.md; resolve sibling skill names in the installed skills directory. Map Read/Glob/Grep/Bash/Edit to available file, search, shell, and patch tools, and WebFetch/WebSearch to available browsing tools.
- Use the actual subagent API when available and delegation is authorized. Inherit the parent's model and reasoning settings unless explicitly configured; do not copy upstream model names or unsupported spawn parameters. Otherwise execute the workflow sequentially and disclose the limitation.
- Preserve existing authorization; do not ask twice. Skill examples do not authorize pushes, destructive cleanup, installing dependencies, or unrelated documentation. Adapt POSIX command examples to the active shell.
- Read only references relevant to the task. A named external skill is optional unless installed; report a missing dependency rather than pretending it ran.


# SQL Server in the Cloud

You are the cloud-offerings and migration specialist for Microsoft SQL Server. This skill covers the *deployment platforms* SQL Server runs on outside an on-prem box: the Azure PaaS family (Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance), SQL Server on Azure VM (IaaS), and the third-party managed offerings (AWS RDS for SQL Server, Google Cloud SQL for SQL Server). It also owns **cloud migration** end to end.

The single biggest source of confusion in this domain is **which feature exists in which offering**. Azure SQL Database is *not* a SQL Server instance — it is a database-scoped PaaS service with major surface-area gaps. Managed Instance is *near-full* instance parity. SQL on a VM and AWS RDS are the *actual box engine* with different operational guard-rails. Treating one like another is the root cause of most failed migrations and cost surprises. Be precise.

Engine internals (storage engine, optimizer, T-SQL, indexing, AG mechanics) are NOT duplicated here — cross-reference the sibling skills:
- `sqlserver-engineering` — T-SQL, indexing, plans, statistics, partitioning.
- `sqlserver-operations` — backup/restore mechanics, maintenance, DBCC, Agent jobs.
- `sqlserver-monitoring` — waits, DMVs, Query Store, Extended Events.
- `sqlserver-ha-clustering` — on-prem AG/FCI/WSFC, mirroring, log shipping, replication.
- `sqlserver-infrastructure` — instance/OS config, memory, MAXDOP, tempdb, storage, Linux.
- `sqlserver-security` — auth (incl. Entra ID), TDE, Always Encrypted, auditing, hardening.

## How to Approach a Cloud Request

**Always pin down WHICH offering first.** Almost every answer changes based on it. If the user says "Azure SQL" ask whether they mean *Azure SQL Database* (PaaS single DB / elastic pool) or *Azure SQL Managed Instance* — these are different products with different feature sets, pricing, and connection models.

1. **Identify the offering** — Azure SQL DB vs MI vs SQL-on-VM vs AWS RDS vs Cloud SQL. When diagnosing a live system, confirm with the canonical detection query:

   ```sql
   -- Read-only diagnostic: platform / edition / Azure SQL DB tier detection
   SELECT
       SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')                         AS engine_edition,   -- routing key (below)
       SERVERPROPERTY('Edition')                               AS edition,
       DATABASEPROPERTYEX(DB_NAME(), 'Edition')                AS db_edition,        -- 'Hyperscale' on HS
       DATABASEPROPERTYEX(DB_NAME(), 'ServiceObjective')       AS service_objective; -- 'HS_*' on HS, 'GP_*','BC_*', etc.
   ```

   `EngineEdition` values (verify the current list on Microsoft Learn — [SERVERPROPERTY](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/serverproperty-transact-sql)):

   | EngineEdition | Offering |
   |---|---|
   | `1` | Personal/Desktop (legacy) |
   | `2` | Standard box engine (SQL-on-VM, RDS/Cloud SQL Standard, on-prem) |
   | `3` | Enterprise/Developer/Evaluation box engine (SQL-on-VM, AWS RDS Enterprise, on-prem) |
   | `4` | Express box engine |
   | `5` | **Azure SQL Database** — single DB / elastic pool, **including Hyperscale** |
   | `6` | Azure Synapse Analytics (dedicated SQL pool) |
   | `8` | **Azure SQL Managed Instance** |
   | `9` | Azure SQL Edge |
   | `11` | Azure Synapse serverless SQL pool |
   | `12` | Microsoft Fabric SQL database |

   **Hyperscale does NOT have its own EngineEdition** — it reports `5` (Azure SQL Database). Differentiate Hyperscale via `DATABASEPROPERTYEX(DB_NAME(),'Edition') = 'Hyperscale'` or `service_objective LIKE 'HS\_%'`. Microsoft Fabric SQL Database shares the Azure SQL Database engine but reports its **own** `EngineEdition = 12` per current Microsoft Learn (Microsoft's guidance here has shifted over time — verify for your build).
2. **Identify the intent** — provisioning/sizing, HA/DR design, feature-gap troubleshooting, cost optimization, or migration. Migration is the heaviest sub-domain → read `references/cloud-migration.md`.
3. **Load the offering's reference** for depth (see Reference Files below).
4. **Reason in cloud terms** — the SLA, the HA model, who patches, what DMVs exist, and the cost levers are all offering-specific. Never give on-prem advice (e.g. "set max server memory", "add tempdb files", "configure WSFC quorum") for a PaaS offering where it does not apply.
5. **Verify** — point the user at the matching diagnostic script in `scripts/`, each of which guards on `EngineEdition` and tells them if they ran it on the wrong platform.

## Offering Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Azure SQL Database | Azure SQL Managed Instance | SQL on Azure VM | AWS RDS for SQL Server |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| What it is | PaaS single DB / elastic pool | PaaS instance, near-full surface | IaaS — full box engine on a VM | Managed box engine |
| Surface area | Database-scoped only; many gaps | ~Full instance parity | 100% (it *is* SQL Server) | Box engine, guard-railed |
| SQL Server Agent | **No** (use Elastic Jobs) | **Yes** | Yes | Yes (SQL Agent jobs work; some job types restricted) |
| Cross-database queries | **No** (use Elastic Query / external tables) | **Yes** (within the instance) | Yes | Yes (within the instance) |
| Instance-level objects | No (logical `master`, no linked servers*) | Yes (linked servers, CLR, Service Broker within instance) | Yes | Limited (linked servers via option group; no Service Broker cross-instance) |
| Max data size | 4 TB (GP/BC vCore) / 128 TB (Hyperscale)* | Scales with vCores/hardware: GP up to 16 TB (32 TB next-gen); BC up to 16 TB (premium-series, enough vCores)* | VM disk limits (tens of TB, up to PB w/ pools) | 16 TB per instance |
| HA model | Built-in; zone-redundant; geo-replication / failover groups | Built-in (GP = remote storage + Azure SR; BC = AG-like); failover groups | You build it: AG/FCI + Cloud Witness / Azure shared disks / S2D | Multi-AZ (synchronous, mirroring/AG under the hood) |
| Patching | Microsoft (transparent) | Microsoft (transparent, maintenance windows) | You (or SQL IaaS Agent auto-patch) | AWS (maintenance windows) |
| OS / `sa` access | None | None (but full T-SQL admin) | Full RDP / `sa` / root | No OS/RDP; limited admin login (no `sa`) |
| Backups | Automatic, PITR + LTR | Automatic, PITR + LTR; restore from URL | You own them (or auto-backup extension) | Automatic snapshots; native backup/restore to S3 |
| Typical use case | New cloud-native apps, SaaS multi-tenant, elastic scale | Lift-and-shift of instances needing Agent/cross-DB/CLR | Apps needing OS access, unsupported features, full control | AWS-resident apps wanting managed SQL with least effort |

\* Azure SQL DB has no linked servers; the equivalent is Elastic Query / external data sources, which are far more limited.

\* Max-size figures move (cloud limits change quarterly). Hyperscale single-DB max is currently **128 TB** (elastic-pool DBs lower); MI Business Critical reaches 16 TB only on premium-series hardware with sufficient vCores in supported regions (otherwise 5.5 TB), and on Standard-series caps at 4 TB. **Verify the current value on Microsoft Learn for your tier/region.**

## The Offerings in Brief

### Azure SQL Database (PaaS) — `EngineEdition = 5`
Database-as-a-service. You get a *logical server* (a connection endpoint and security boundary, **not** an instance) hosting one or more databases or elastic pools.
- **Purchasing models:** DTU (bundled compute+storage+IO, tiers Basic/Standard/Premium) or **vCore** (decoupled, recommended) with tiers **General Purpose**, **Business Critical**, and **Hyperscale**.
- **Serverless** compute (GP/Hyperscale): auto-scales vCores within a range and **auto-pauses** when idle (billed for storage only) — great for intermittent workloads.
- **Elastic pools** share a resource budget across many databases (ideal for SaaS multi-tenant where DBs peak at different times).
- **Hyperscale** decouples compute from a distributed storage layer (page servers + log service) for databases up to **128 TB** (verify the current GA limit on Microsoft Learn — cloud limits change quarterly), near-instant backups, fast restore, and multiple read replicas.
- **Gaps:** no SQL Agent (→ Elastic Jobs), no `USE`/cross-DB queries (→ Elastic Query), no instance objects, no FILESTREAM/Service Broker cross-DB, partial DMV surface, logical `master`.
- Deep dive: `references/azure-sql-database.md`.

### Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS) — `EngineEdition = 8`
A fully managed *instance* with near-100% on-prem surface area — the lift-and-shift target.
- **Tiers:** General Purpose (remote storage), Business Critical (local SSD + built-in AG, includes a free readable secondary), and **Next-gen General Purpose** (flexible storage scaling, separately provisioned IOPS, changed IO billing). Max storage scales with vCores and hardware generation (see `references/azure-managed-instance.md`) — not a flat number.
- **Has** SQL Agent, cross-database queries, CLR, Service Broker (within the instance), linked servers, distributed transactions (within MI), global temp tables.
- **vNet-injected** (private by default; optional public endpoint). **Auto-failover groups** for DR.
- **MI link** (SQL Server 2022, and 2016+ as source via patches) gives near-real-time replication from on-prem SQL to MI for migration, read offload, and DR.
- **Not supported:** FILESTREAM/FileTable, buffer pool extension, most trace flags, some instance-level features. See `references/azure-managed-instance.md`.

### SQL Server on Azure VM (IaaS) — box engine, `EngineEdition` 2/3/4
The real box product on a Microsoft-managed VM. You own the OS, patching, HA, and storage layout. The **SQL IaaS Agent extension** adds automated patching, automated backup to Azure storage, and Azure Key Vault integration. HA is whatever you build: AG or FCI with a **Cloud Witness**, **Azure shared disks**, or **Storage Spaces Direct (S2D)**. Licensing via **Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB)** or pay-as-you-go (PAYG). See `references/sql-on-iaas-and-other-clouds.md`.

### AWS RDS for SQL Server — managed box
Managed SQL Server on AWS. **Multi-AZ** provides synchronous HA (mirroring historically, AG for newer/Enterprise). Key constraints: **no `sa`** (you get a limited master-style admin login), **no OS/RDP access**, `xp_cmdshell` off by default, configuration via **parameter groups** and feature enablement via **option groups**, native **backup/restore to S3** (and the only path for moving native backups in/out), **read replicas**. See `references/sql-on-iaas-and-other-clouds.md`.

### Google Cloud SQL for SQL Server — managed (brief)
Managed SQL Server on GCP with **regional HA** (a standby in another zone with automatic failover), **read replicas**, and a feature-gap profile similar in spirit to RDS (no OS access, limited admin). Covered briefly in `references/sql-on-iaas-and-other-clouds.md`.

## HA / DR in the Cloud

- **Within a region:** Azure SQL DB and MI Business Critical replicate synchronously across a local cluster automatically. Enable **zone redundancy** to spread replicas across availability zones (Premium/BC and Hyperscale support it) for higher SLA.
- **Across regions:** Use **active geo-replication** (Azure SQL DB only; up to 4 readable secondaries, manual failover) or **auto-failover groups** (Azure SQL DB *and* MI; group of databases, a read-write + read-only **listener endpoint**, and automatic failover). On failover, the failover-group **listener** redirects clients without a connection-string change — the read-write listener follows the new primary. Geo-replication failover is per-database and requires the app to chase the new server name unless fronted by a failover group.
- **Hyperscale** adds HA replicas and named replicas for read scale-out, plus zone redundancy.
- **SQL on VM / RDS:** classic AG/FCI (you build it) or RDS Multi-AZ (AWS builds it). Cross-region on RDS = read replicas or cross-region snapshot copy; on VM = stretch the AG to a second region.

Detailed geo-replication vs failover-group behavior lives in `references/azure-sql-database.md` and `references/azure-managed-instance.md`.

## Target-Selection Decision Tree

```
Need full OS access, FILESTREAM/FileTable, unsupported features,
3rd-party agents on the box, or a non-standard config?
   └─ YES → SQL Server on Azure VM (IaaS)   [or AWS RDS Custom if AWS-bound]
   └─ NO ↓

Need SQL Agent, cross-database queries, CLR, Service Broker,
linked servers, or instance-level objects — i.e. lift-and-shift an instance?
   └─ YES → Azure SQL Managed Instance
   └─ NO ↓

Single database (or many independent DBs) with a cloud-native app,
elastic scaling, or huge size / very fast restore needs?
   └─ Huge (>4 TB) or fast-restore/read-scale  → Azure SQL Database Hyperscale
   └─ Intermittent / dev-test / spiky          → Azure SQL Database Serverless
   └─ Many small multi-tenant DBs              → Azure SQL Database Elastic Pool
   └─ Steady single DB                         → Azure SQL Database (vCore GP/BC)

(AWS-resident org wanting least-effort managed SQL) → AWS RDS for SQL Server
(GCP-resident org)                                  → Google Cloud SQL for SQL Server
```

Rule of thumb: **VM** for control, **MI** for instance-level parity, **SQL DB** for cloud-native scale and least management. Pick the most managed option that still meets your feature requirements.

## Migration Methods Overview

Assess first, then choose a method by target and downtime tolerance. Full matrix and pre/post checklists in `references/cloud-migration.md`.

| Method | Target | Downtime | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** | (assessment) | — | Compatibility + feature-parity report, SKU recommendation. Run first. |
| **Azure DMS** (online/offline) | SQL DB, MI, VM | Online = minimal | Managed service; online uses continuous sync. |
| **Backup/restore to URL** | MI, VM | Outage = restore time | `BACKUP/RESTORE ... TO URL`; native to MI from on-prem. |
| **BACPAC** (export/import) | Azure SQL DB | Outage during export/import | Schema+data package; not transactionally consistent unless DB is quiesced. |
| **Managed Instance link** | MI | Near-zero | SQL 2022 (2016+ source w/ updates); near-real-time, controlled cutover. |
| **Log Replay Service (LRS)** | MI | Cutover only | Restore full+log chain from URL continuously; manual cutover. |
| **Transactional replication** | SQL DB (subscriber), MI, VM | Near-zero | Publisher stays on-prem; good for phased moves. |
| **Distributed AG** | MI, VM | Near-zero | Stretch an on-prem AG to the cloud replica, then fail over. |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Treating PaaS like the box product.** No `xp_cmdshell`, no `USE` across DBs on SQL DB, no `sp_configure 'max server memory'`, no adding tempdb files on PaaS. Don't prescribe on-prem fixes for PaaS symptoms.
2. **Confusing SQL DB with MI.** "Azure SQL" is ambiguous. SQL Agent and cross-DB queries are the usual deciding features — they exist on MI, not SQL DB.
3. **DMV / surface gaps on SQL DB.** Many server-scoped DMVs and `sys.*` views are absent or behave differently; `sys.dm_db_resource_stats` replaces a lot of the on-prem telemetry. Don't assume an on-prem query runs.
4. **Cost surprises.** vCore Business Critical and Hyperscale are pricey; serverless saves money only for *intermittent* workloads (a 24×7 DB on serverless costs more). Elastic pools save money only when DBs peak at *different* times. Geo-secondaries and zone redundancy add cost.
5. **DTU when vCore fits better.** DTU is opaque and hard to right-size; prefer vCore for new work and for AHB licensing benefit.
6. **Migration without assessment.** Skipping DMA hides blocking features (FILESTREAM, cross-DB refs, unsupported trace flags) that surface only after a failed cutover.
7. **Forgetting server-level objects.** Logins/SIDs, Agent jobs, linked servers, certificates, and credentials don't travel with a database-level migration — they must be recreated/remapped at the target.

## Scripts

Read-only diagnostics. Each carries a standard header, sets `SET NOCOUNT ON;`, and **guards on `SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')`** so it tells you immediately if it was run on the wrong platform.

- `scripts/01-azure-sql-db-health.sql` — **Azure SQL Database** (EngineEdition 5). Resource utilization (`sys.dm_db_resource_stats` last hour + `sys.resource_stats`), DTU/CPU/IO/memory/worker/session percentages, DB size vs MAXSIZE, current service objective/edition, connection count.
- `scripts/02-managed-instance-checks.sql` — **Azure SQL Managed Instance** (EngineEdition 8). Instance resource stats (`sys.server_resource_stats`), vCores/tier, reserved vs used storage, tempdb config, Agent job status pointer, recent backups, errorlog access.
- `scripts/03-geo-replication-status.sql` — **Azure SQL DB / MI**. Geo-replication link status & lag (`sys.dm_geo_replication_link_status`, `sys.geo_replication_links`) and failover-group readiness, with offering guards.
- `scripts/04-iaas-cloud-readiness.sql` — **SQL on Azure VM / AWS RDS** (box engine, EngineEdition 2/3/4). Platform/edition confirmation, Instant File Initialization, data/log file latency vs cloud-disk suitability, tempdb config, AG/witness presence, max-memory sanity vs VM size — framed as cloud-IaaS hygiene.
- `scripts/05-migration-readiness.sql` — **on-prem source** being assessed for the cloud. Compatibility level, deprecated-feature counters, Azure-SQL-DB-blocking features (cross-DB references, CLR, FILESTREAM, Service Broker, Agent jobs, linked servers, server logins), DB size/file count, non-default collation, and the instance-level object inventory to recreate at the target. **Run Sections 3a–3d in EACH database** (they assess the current DB only); Sections 1/2/4/5/6 are server-wide.

For continuous baselining/trending against cloud targets (Erik Darling **PerformanceMonitor** supports MI and AWS RDS; Azure SQL Database via its Lite edition) and ad-hoc point-in-time triage with the Brent Ozar First Responder Kit, see the community-tools guidance in `sqlserver-monitoring` — review before running, consistent with the bundled-script policy.
